            Overnight scenes, dinner and wine <br>
            Saturdays girls <br>
            I was never in love, never had the time <br>
            In my hustle and hurry world <br>
            Laughing my self to sleep <br>
            Waking up lonely <br>
            I needed someone to hold me, oh <br>
            It's such a crazy old town <br>
            It can drag you down <br>
            'Til you run out of dreams <br>
            So you party all night to the music and lights <br>
            But you don't what happiness means <br>
            I was dancing in the dark with strangers <br>
            No love around me <br>
            When suddenly you found me, oh <br>
            Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
            You're my fantasy, you're my reality <br>
            Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
            You're everything I need, you're everything to me <br>
            Oh girl <br>
            Everything good, everything fine <br>
            That's what you are <br>
            So put your hand in mine <br>
            And together we'll climb <br>
            As high as the highest star <br>
            I'm living a lifetime in every minute <br>
            That we're together <br>
            And I'm staying right here forever, oh <br>
            Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
            You're my fantasy, you're my reality <br>
            Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
            You're everything I need, you're everything to me <br>
            Oh girl <br>
            Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
            You're my fantasy, you're my reality <br>
