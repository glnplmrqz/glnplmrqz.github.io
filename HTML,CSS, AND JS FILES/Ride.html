            I just wanna stay in the sun where I find <br>
            I know it's hard sometimes<br>
            Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind<br>
            I know it's hard sometimes<br>
            Yeah, I think about the end just way too much<br>
            But it's fun to fantasize<br>
            On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was<br>
            But it's fun to fantasize<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
            Takin' my time on my ride<br>
            "I'd die for you" that's easy to say<br>
            We have a list of people that we would take<br>
            A bullet for them, a bullet for you<br>
            A bullet for everybody in this room<br>
            But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through<br>
            See many bullets coming through<br>
            Metaphorically, I'm the man<br>
            But literally, I don't know what I'd do<br>
            "I'd live for you" and that's hard to do<br>
            Even harder to say, when you know it's not true<br>
            Even harder to write, when you know that's a lie<br>
            There were people back home who tried talking to you<br>
            But then you ignore them still<br>
            All these questions they're for real, like<br>
            "Who would you live for?"<br>
            "Who would you die for?"<br>
            And "Would you ever kill?"<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
            Takin' my time on my ride<br>
